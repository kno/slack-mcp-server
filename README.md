# Slack MCP Server

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Slack Workspaces. The most powerful MCP Slack server — supports Stdio, SSE and HTTP transports, proxy settings, DMs, Group DMs, Smart History fetch (by date or count), may work via OAuth or in complete stealth mode with no permissions and scopes in Workspace 😏.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> We need your support! Each month, over 30,000 engineers visit this repository, and more than 9,000 are already using it.
> 
> If you appreciate the work our [contributors](https://github.com/c3-oss/slack-mcp-server/graphs/contributors) have put into this project, please consider giving the repository a star.

This feature-rich Slack MCP Server has:
- **Stealth and OAuth Modes**: Run the server without requiring additional permissions or bot installations (stealth mode), or use secure OAuth tokens for access without needing to refresh or extract tokens from the browser (OAuth mode).
- **Enterprise Workspaces Support**: Possibility to integrate with Enterprise Slack setups.
- **Channel and Thread Support with `#Name` `@Lookup`**: Fetch messages from channels and threads, including activity messages, and retrieve channels using their names (e.g., #general) as well as their IDs.
- **Smart History**: Fetch messages with pagination by date (d1, 7d, 1m) or message count.
- **Unread Messages**: Get all unread messages across channels efficiently with priority sorting (DMs > partner channels > internal), @mention filtering, and mark-as-read support.
- **Search Messages**: Search messages in channels, threads, and DMs using various filters like date, user, and content.
- **Safe Message Posting**: The `conversations_add_message` tool is disabled by default for safety. Enable it via an environment variable, with optional channel restrictions.
- **Native Message Forwarding**: The `conversations_forward_message` tool uses Slack's native embedded quote card without exposing the source permalink in message text. It requires browser session (`xoxc`/`xoxd`) authentication and is disabled by default.
- **DM and Group DM support**: Retrieve direct messages and group direct messages.
- **Embedded user information**: Embed user information in messages, for better context.
- **Cache support**: Cache users and channels for faster access.
- **Stdio/SSE/HTTP Transports & Proxy Support**: Use the server with any MCP client that supports Stdio, SSE or HTTP transports, and configure it to route outgoing requests through a proxy if needed.

### 4. conversations_forward_message
Forward an existing message to another Slack conversation as a native embedded quote card. Slack preserves the original author, blocks, and message actions inside the forwarded attachment; the source permalink is not added to the visible message text.

> **Note:** Native forwarding uses Slack's internal `chat.shareMessage` endpoint and requires browser session authentication with both `SLACK_MCP_XOXC_TOKEN` and `SLACK_MCP_XOXD_TOKEN`. It is unavailable with `xoxp` or `xoxb` tokens. The tool is disabled by default; enable it with `SLACK_MCP_FORWARD_MESSAGE_TOOL=true`, a destination-channel allowlist, or by explicitly listing it in `SLACK_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS`.

Search messages in a public channel, private channel, or direct message (DM, or IM) conversation using filters. All filters are optional, if not provided then search_query is required.

> **Note**: This tool is not available when using bot tokens (`xoxb-*`). Bot tokens cannot use the `search.messages` API.
- **Parameters:**
  - `search_query` (string, optional): Search query to filter messages. Example: 'marketing report' or full URL of Slack message e.g. 'https://slack.com/archives/C1234567890/p1234567890123456', then the tool will return a single message matching given URL, herewith all other parameters will be ignored.

  - `Title`: User's job title
  - `DMChannelID`: DM channel ID if available in cache (for quick messaging)

### 10. usergroups_list:
List all user groups (subteams) in the workspace.

- **Parameters:**
  - `include_users` (boolean, default: false): Include list of user IDs in each group.
  - `include_count` (boolean, default: true): Include user count for each group.
  - `include_disabled` (boolean, default: false): Include disabled/archived groups.

- **Returns:** CSV with fields: id, name, handle, description, user_count, is_external

> **Required OAuth scopes:** `usergroups:read`

### 11. usergroups_create:
Create a new user group in the workspace.

- **Parameters:**
  - `name` (string, required): Name of the user group (e.g., "Engineering Team").
  - `handle` (string, optional): Mention handle without @ (e.g., "engineering"). If not provided, Slack will auto-generate one.
  - `description` (string, optional): Purpose or description of the group.
  - `channels` (string, optional): Comma-separated channel IDs for default channels where group mentions will be highlighted.

- **Returns:** JSON with created group details (id, name, handle, description)

  - For `join`/`leave`: JSON with result message and updated group info

> **Required OAuth scopes:** `usergroups:read` (for list), `usergroups:read` + `usergroups:write` (for join/leave)

### 15. conversations_unreads
Get unread messages across all channels efficiently. Uses a single API call to identify channels with unreads, then fetches only those messages. Results are prioritized: DMs > partner channels (Slack Connect) > internal channels.

> **Note:** This tool works best with browser session tokens (`xoxc`/`xoxd`), which use the efficient `client.counts` API. For standard OAuth tokens (`xoxp`), a fallback method using `conversations.info` is used, which requires one API call per channel and may be slower for large workspaces. Not available with bot tokens (`xoxb`).

- **Parameters:**
  - `include_messages` (boolean, default: true): If true, returns the actual unread messages. If false, returns only a summary of channels with unreads.
  - `channel_types` (string, default: "all"): Filter by channel type: `all`, `dm` (direct messages), `group_dm` (group DMs), `partner` (externally shared channels), `internal` (regular workspace channels).
  - `max_channels` (number, default: 50): Maximum number of channels to fetch unreads from.
  - `max_messages_per_channel` (number, default: 10): Maximum messages to fetch per channel.
  - `mentions_only` (boolean, default: false): If true, only returns channels where you have @mentions. Note: This filter only works with browser tokens; OAuth tokens will return all unread channels.

### 16. conversations_mark
Mark a channel or DM as read.

> **Note:** Marking messages as read is disabled by default for safety. To enable, set the `SLACK_MCP_MARK_TOOL` environment variable to `true` or `1`. See the Environment Variables section below for details.

- **Parameters:**
  - `channel_id` (string, required): ID of the channel in format `Cxxxxxxxxxx` or its name starting with `#...` or `@...` (e.g., `#general`, `@username`).
  - `ts` (string, optional): Timestamp of the message to mark as read up to. If not provided, marks all messages as read.

### 17. saved_list
List saved items from Slack's "Save for Later" panel. Returns items the user has saved, with optional message content. This replaces the deprecated `stars.list` API ([changelog](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2023-07-its-later-already-for-stars-and-reminders)).

> **Note:** This tool requires browser session tokens (`xoxc`/`xoxd`). It is not available with standard OAuth (`xoxp`) or bot (`xoxb`) tokens.

- **Parameters:**
  - `filter` (string, default `"saved"`): Filter saved items: `"saved"` (active/in-progress), `"completed"` (marked done), `"archived"`.
  - `limit` (number, default `50`): Maximum number of items to return. Auto-paginates.
  - `include_messages` (boolean, default `true`): If true, fetches the actual saved message content. If false, returns metadata only.
  - `max_messages_per_item` (number, default `5`): Max messages to fetch per saved item (for thread replies).

### 18. saved_update
Update a saved item: mark as completed, set a due date/reminder, or both. Use `item_id` and `ts` values from `saved_list` output. This replaces the deprecated `stars.add`/`stars.remove` APIs.

> **Note:** This tool requires browser session tokens (`xoxc`/`xoxd`). It is not available with standard OAuth (`xoxp`) or bot (`xoxb`) tokens.

- **Parameters:**
  - `item_id` (string, required): Channel/DM ID where the saved message lives (from `saved_list` output).
  - `ts` (string, required): Message timestamp of the saved item (from `saved_list` output).
  - `mark` (string, optional): Set to `"completed"` to mark the item as done.
  - `date_due` (number, optional): Unix timestamp for due date/reminder. Set to `0` to clear.

### 19. saved_clear_completed
Clear all completed saved items from the "Save for Later" panel. This is a bulk operation that removes all items with `state="completed"`.

> **Note:** This tool requires browser session tokens (`xoxc`/`xoxd`). It is not available with standard OAuth (`xoxp`) or bot (`xoxb`) tokens.

- **Parameters:** None.

### 20. drafts_list
List drafts for the authenticated user. Session authentication (`xoxc`/`xoxd`) only; use the returned draft IDs, destination channel IDs, and timestamps for write operations.

### 21. drafts_create
Create a draft. A scheduled draft is SENT by Slack at its scheduled time, so its channel must be allowed by `SLACK_MCP_ADD_MESSAGE_TOOL` (or `conversations_add_message` must be explicitly enabled).

### 22. drafts_update
Update a draft using values from `drafts_list`; the server pads `client_last_updated_ts` to seven decimal places. The server looks the draft up first: every current destination must be allowed by `SLACK_MCP_DRAFTS_TOOL`, and an already scheduled draft can only be retargeted to a channel allowed by `SLACK_MCP_ADD_MESSAGE_TOOL`.

### 23. drafts_delete
Delete a draft. With an allow-all drafts policy and an explicit timestamp, deletion is direct. Otherwise the server looks it up and refuses when it is missing, its destination is unknown, or any of its destination channels is not allowed.

All draft tools require session authentication. Write tools use `SLACK_MCP_DRAFTS_TOOL`: `true`, `1`, or `yes` enables all channels; comma-separated values allowlist channels; `!channel` entries form a denylist. When empty, write tools require exact-name listing in `SLACK_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS`.
